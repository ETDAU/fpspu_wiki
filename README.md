## Text Editors - How to write Programs

Programing requires a text editor. Yeah... It's weird that way. Here are the 2 most common ones <br>

[Notepad ++] (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/7.x/7.2.2/npp.7.2.2.bin.zip)  < - SODO not required. Open .exe <br>

## Github - Code Repository and Version Control 
This is how our unit is going to version control our app/programs/stuff. 
[Click here] (https://github.com) to take me there (though this is written in git markdown so you should be "here" already) 
[Download Here] (https://desktop.github.com/) -> SODO 

There are 2 ways to github: Use the web graphical interface 


## Slack - How to communicate with everybody

##Tips and Tricks

####OPSGuest Wifi
This exists. It requires the guest to request for it using an ontario.ca email... But I'm sure you can figure it out. This is handy if you decide to bring your own laptop to run code from or to get around SODO requests 

####Outlook Webmail 
Need to check your email at home? [Webmail] (https://webmail.ontario.ca) 


####Directory 
Need to find out where someone works? [Info-Go] (http://www.infogo.gov.on.ca)
